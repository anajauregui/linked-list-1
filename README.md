#### Linked List ####

The project of Linked List was the first paired project of 1705 front end.  The concept behind this project is the basic storage of web links on a page for later reference.  The User is prompted to enter a website title and a Url in the input boxes and then by pushing the enter button a card is generated in the stored links section containing this info.  If the user does not properly fill out the input fields they will be notified by a pop up message.  Once the links are stored the user can click the link to visit the page, mark as read or delete all together.  there is a separate button that will also clear out all the "read" links from the stored section.  A counter is located at the bottom of the page which will track how many links are currently stored as well as the number of "read" links.  the page is fully responsive operating the same on both desktop and mobile devices.
